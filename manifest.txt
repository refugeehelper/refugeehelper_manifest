### REFUGEEHELPER ALLIANCE MANIFEST

We are a group of individuals and companies who want to see a Europe where people help each other, regardless of nationalities. We are developing content and software for refugees and we understand that it is better to work together rather than reinventing the wheel in hundreds of small projects. To maximize our efforts for helping the refugees in need, we are committed to these following conditions to work together as one big movement:

1. we respect and listen to the needs of refugees and refugee helpers, because they are our main customers
2. we search for existing, similar projects and merge ideas and efforts to maximize impact in big solutions backed by many people rather than focusing on our own small solutions
3. we are part of an ecosystem for refugee apps and content, so we share content, ideas and code with our friends to speed up the development of high quality output
4. we want to professionalize this ecosystem, therefore we need money - we group up in teams to gather that money from accelerator and EU funding programs and we organize calls for donations together while we share our experience to help other teams
5. we spread the word about this commitment to grow a professional culture of sharing in a culture of welcome
